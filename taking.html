           <h1 class="Titel">Overview</h1> <p class="inline-text">Taking the first step online can be intimidating, scary almost. But we’re here to help you cross that line and dare to be the change. Here are our top five ways to start a conversation. </p>

    <div class="speech-bubble-tip1" contenteditable>
        <h1 class="Titel">Be simple, and straight to the point</h1> <p class="inline-text">Keep it simple and straight to the point. Nine times out of ten they won’t rate cheesy gifs, just get straight into a nice and flowing convo. Ask how their day was or if they have plans for the weekend – it’s really not difficult. Then after establishing a bit of chat, the convo can get more interesting. Just sometimes a sext at 10am from a random Tinder match just isn’t needed.
        </p>

 <div class="speech-bubble-tip2" contenteditable>
    <h1 class="Titel">Cliche, but be yourself.</h1> <p class="inline-text"> Trying to cater your personality to fit someone else’s need usually ends up with you having to write down what you’re going to write to them, or sending your texts back and forth with your best friends to “find the right thing to write”. 
        
        All of that is fun for like a minute, but after a while when you’ve written your fify eleventh note on what you're going to say, it’s going to get boring or frustrating
        
        
    </p>
</div>

<div class="speech-bubble-tip3" contenteditable>
    <h1 class="Titel">Communication</h1> <p class="inline-text"> As a rule of thumb, texting someone new means keeping things light and involves back-and-forth dialogue about shared interests, finding common ground, and learning about who they are. It takes some time getting to know someone's communication style.

        The key to conversation starters is to be interested in the other person without coming across as anxious or desperate for attention.
        Keep it light and show you have a genuine interest by reaching out with questions that allow for responses beyond one word.

</div>


<div class="speech-bubble-tip4" contenteditable>
    <h1 class="Titel">Start with a simple topic</h1> <p class="inline-text"> You don’t have to reinvent the wheel here; just asking your interest  if they’ve seen the latest episode of your favorite show or what they did over the weekend is a great way to start a conversation. If you pick something that interests both of you, such as sports, TV, or the upcoming elections, then you’ll be off to a great start.
        <p class="inline-text"> Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to pick the best conversational topic ever, at first. If the one you start with is a no go, then you can always find a way to change the topic. Remember that there’s a bit less pressure to maintain a seamless conversation than you’d feel over the phone or in person.</p>
       

        <p class="inline-text">If the person doesn’t bite or sounds busy, just switch to another topic that you’re sure will generate some more enthusiasm.
        </p></p> 
</div>


<div class="speech-bubble-tip5" contenteditable>
    <h1 class="Titel">Have fun</h1> <p class="inline-text"> And don’t get too attached to them. Remember that dating is a game of give and take and if you’re the only one giving and they’re just receiving, barely that. Then it’s time to start letting go. That sometimes even helps the person of interest realise that you don’t find them interesting anymore, which could also lead to them trying more to make a connection. Many people take things for granted quite fast after getting used to something.
