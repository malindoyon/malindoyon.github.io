    <div class="pSpecialSelf">
        <p>In the age of crippling college debt and chaotic headlines, showing yourself 
            love is harder than ever. It feels impossible to find inner peace in a
             world full of pressure. How can we appreciate ourselves better? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="selfC">   
        <h2 class="part">1. Stick With Your Tempo</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>Some people like to message potential dates for a few weeks before 
                meeting up. Some people like to get off an app and meet in person as 
                soon as possible. Some people are comfortable sleeping with a date 
                quickly and others will consider a kiss after numerous dates. <br><br>
                All of these speeds are fine as long as all parties are consenting.
                Be sure to figure out what speed you’re personally comfortable 
                with and share that speed with your date so everyone is on the same page.
                 Follow your intuition on this and don’t ignore any bad gut feelings 
                 just because you want to be accomodating or something. 
                 There’s nothing wrong with changing tempos as feelings bubble up, 
                 but consent is mandatory.<br><br>
                If someone you’re dating wants things to go faster/slower/different 
                than what you’re comfortable with, then there’s a compatibility issue. 
                Date someone who respects your boundaries. Prioritize your safety and 
                keep your well-being in mind. Your wants and needs are worth it – 
                YOU ARE WORTH IT!</p>            
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="selfC"> 
        <h2 class="part">2. Check-In With Yourself</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>Once you’ve gone on a few dates with someone, it’s typical to spend 
                time thinking all about the other person, to worry about what that 
                person thinks about you and so on. You want to know if they think 
                you’re attractive/interesting/someone they could see themselves in 
                a relationship with and so-on.<br><br>
                It is completely normal to want to be a mind-reader during this phase. 
                Instead of wishing for powers you do not have, focus on being your own
                 mind-reader.<br><br>
                It is more important to ask yourself what you think about this person. 
                Checking in with your own personal thoughts and feelings is an act of 
                self-care that is too-often pushed to the side when the butterflies 
                are distracting us.<br><br>
                When someone has caught your attention in a significant way, be sure 
                to dig deep within yourself and try to unpack those feelings. 
                What is it you like about this person? Do they check your prerequisite 
                boxes?<br><br>
                Ask yourself the hard-hitting questions to avoid the wrath of 
                unprocessed chaos haunting you later. Once you know your own answers, 
                you’ll feel more confident while talking to your date about theirs.</p>

    <div class="selfC"> 
        <h2 class="part">3. Make Time For Yourself</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>Dates can take a lot of time and energy. Swiping and matching takes a 
                lot of brain space and in-person dates can get expensive. 
                Going on multiple dates per week on top of work and life can be 
                plain exhausting depending on your personality type.<br><br>
                Remember to carve out some alone time in the midst of dating life and 
                do some nice things just for yourself. Reserve a night for yourself to sit on the couch and watch a movie while the laundry machine is running. Get a massage, explore a new neighborhood, or treat yourself to a fancy dinner. Turn off your phone for a day and don’t feel bad about it.
                You may want to spend all your time talking to a special someone 
                if they’re on your mind, but we all know that clingy lifestyle can
                 get real toxic quickly. Don’t let text conversations with your dates
                  distract you from enjoying what’s beyond the screen. Limit the amount
                   of time you spend swiping to avoid burning out. Maintaining your 
                   independent identity and doing things exclusively for yourself while
                    dating is healthy.</p>

    <div class="selfC"> 
        <h2 class="part">4. Accept the Rejections and Move On</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>Rejection is practically a constant in online dating. Someone you 
                think is cute didn’t match with you or ignores your message. Someone
                 you meet in person ghosts you after a few dates that you thought went 
                 well. It sucks to feel like you’re not good enough.<br><br>
                Rejection might be the hardest part of dating, but you cannot let it 
                determine your happiness or self-worth! It’s essential to remember 
                that rejection is simply part of dating as it is a part of life. There
                 are billions of people on this planet and not all of them can be attracted to you. It would be weird if all of them were, wouldn’t it?
                You might not be what another person is looking for, and that’s okay.
                 Do your best to not take it too personally. Someone else’s opinion of
                  you is strictly theirs and it just is what it is. Remember that you 
                  too have rejected people before for one reason or another. 
                  Take rejection as a learning experience, as a stepping stone for 
                  what’s to come, and keep on keeping on.<br><br>
                If you’re seriously struggling with dating rejection, it might be
                 wise to delete the dating apps from your phone and take some time 
                 to reflect. Consider talking to a therapist about your confidence 
                 and self-worth. RuPaul’s famous episode-concluding phrase goes, 
                 “if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love 
                 somebody else?” Take that quote to heart.</p>

    <div class="selfC"> 
        <h2 class="part">5. Be Present</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>Sometimes anxiety can get the best of anyone and push one to focus
                 on anything but the present when dating. It’s easy to ruminate on
                  past relationship woes and fixate on the future instead of simply 
                  enjoying the moment.<br><br>
                Nerves are normal, but getting too wrapped up in your thoughts is 
                unhelpful when it comes to dating. It closes you off and your date 
                can and will notice that distracted energy. If something major, 
                like a work or family emergency, is going to distract you, just 
                reschedule the date for a calmer time.<br><br>
                When you are present during a date, you can have fun and be your 
                most authentic self. You can delight in someone’s company and remember 
                the nice moments. You can be a better listener and observe the little 
                things. Let yourself have the experience!<br><br>
                Do whatever you have to do to make yourself as present as possible. 
                Meditate in your living space or car to prepare yourself beforehand.
                 Once you’re on the date, make eye contact and take note of the details.
                 Ask thoughtful questions and give in-depth answers. Put your phone away
                  and only check it in the bathroom if you must. Take deep breaths if 
                  you’re feeling nervous and feel free to share your nerves with your date
                   instead of hiding them. There’s a good chance they’re feeling nervous
                    too!<br><br>
                Being present is a true self-care gift to yourself. If you do not enjoy a 
                date, your observant spirit will help you learn from it and inform your 
                future dates. If you happen to go on the best date of your life, you’ll 
                walk away with a fulfilling experience and lovely memory.</p>
