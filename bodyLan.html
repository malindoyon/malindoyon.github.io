    <h1 class="catbody">BODY LANGUAGE, WHO HAS IT?</h1>
    <div class="pSpecialSelf">
        <p> Can you talk with your body? Is it really that important? Body language is crucial in how you are perceived by your date. Use these tricks to show you’re interested, relaxed and have a desire to get closer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="selfC">   
        <h2 class="part">1. Face</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>
                Natural laughter lights up the face and is a genuine sign of relaxation and lets the other person see you’re at ease in their company. Not only does it help you as endorphins are released and stress reduced, it can also allow your vulnerabilities to show because your guard is dropped and this can make you more appealing.

                Laughter rather than restricted smile enables your date to feel closer to you.</p>

    <div class="selfC"> 
        <h2 class= "part">2. Eyes</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p>We intuitively read people’s eyes and are continually interpreting someone’s glance to find out if they are listening, are angry with us, are friendly or avoiding interacting with us. When it comes to dating eye contact is particularly important because it is often the clearest indication if there is a physical attraction and connection.
<br>
<br>
                The reading of body language is an inexact science but you can generally gauge that the date isn’t going too well if they continually drop eye contact and scan the room. Use your own eye contact to good effect. If you really want to let your date know you are interested Judi James, author of The Body Language Bible, says ‘the “flick” is one of the most high-impact signals you can send. Allow your eyes to flit down to their mouth and back up to meet their eyes; this suggests kissing and, combined with a smile, subtle head-tilt, softened eye expression and slowed blink rates all signal sexual approval.’ – use sparingly!</p>

    <div class="selfC"> 
        <h2 class="part">3. Gestures</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
            <p> When chatting with your date, lean forward slightly as this shows genuine interest. When they’re talking make sure you nod and smile to let them know you’re interested in what they’re saying. Slight touching on their upper arm can create feelings of intimacy without inappropriateness, making your date warm to you more.
<br>
<br>
                Those all important first impressions are hugely influenced by how someone is holding themselves. This is what you will notice before they even open their mouth. Judi James suggests ‘When approaching a stranger you want to impress, exude confidence in your stance, even if you’re on edge.’
​
Keep your head up and eyes off the floor, put your shoulders back and make sure your arms and legs are uncrossed as that will indicate openness. Face your date squarely while you are talking to them rather than turning to face the room. Once you are chatting, echoing or mirroring someone’s posture will encourage them to open up to you.
<br>
<br>
Noticing your own posture will make you more aware of other people’s and how much more at ease you feel with someone when their posture invites openness rather than being shut down and defensive

                When your date speaks, don’t forget to lean forward a bit to show how eager to listen what they say
