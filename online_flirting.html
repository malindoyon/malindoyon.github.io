        <h2 class="sometips">Here are some tips</h2>
        <div class="pselfC">
           <ul class="List">
               <ol> <h3 class="headertip">1. Have a friendly conversation</h3>
                Try not to make the conversation so obviously centered around the “dating”, have a normal friendly conversation. Pick one thing on their profile and make fun of him/her, (in a light-hearted way). It creates an instant intimacy and can reveal your charm. But remember to apologize immediately if he/she is offended, a sincere apology can also show that you are considerate and care about other people's emotions.</ol>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <h3 class="headertip">2. Focus on unique, specific compliments</h3>
                Don’t hesitate to flatter your online crush. Talk about what he/she has on their profile. Talk about their hair, eyes, or maybe tattoos - anything that makes them feel you’ve had a pit stop at their profile before writing to them. Knowing someone admires your traits will make him/her smile in real life. That means you’ve opened a door, to friendship maybe, but that’s the first step.
                </ol>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <h3 class="headertip">3. Avoid yes/no questions</h3>
                Don’t be a conversation killer! Generic questions get bland answers and online flirting is not meant to be bland. Keep the conversation exciting, reveal yourself and try to get to know the other person by asking specific questions. Ask something like "Do you like EDM?", then the following text could be "I’m going to this concert and my friend just chickened out, would you like to join?".
                </ol>
<br>
                    <ol>
                        <h3 class="headertip">4. Don’t overdo texting, meet instead!</h3>
                        
Texting for too long can put out the interest in meeting the person in real life. Online dating apps like Sclubber also provide video chat to bring you closer - make use of technology to take your online date to reality sooner. Otherwise you will already start to get bored of the conversations and honestly know a little too much about the person, which kills the excitement.
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <h3 class="headertip">5. Talk about personality</h3>
As much as you talk about their physical features, nothing works like compliments about their happy personality. Repeat your compliment, to create an echo.
                    </ol>
<br>
                    <ol>
                        <h3 class="headertip">6. Exchange photos</h3>
                    
Nope, not giving you “ideas”, but yeah, showing him/her what you and your life looks like in real life, makes them feel a part of your life. A simple picture of your dog or your messy study room will work too.
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <h3 class="headertip">7. Use interesting words</h3>
Data says, messages that use the word "adorable" get 64% more responses. Amuse them with words to make them feel special about the conversations.
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <h3 class="headertip">8. Be upfront and clear</h3>
It’s a dating platform and nobody is a kid no more. Be bold and plan a date as soon as you get interested. Or, if you’d rather let the other person initiate, say: “Just so you know, if you ask me out I’ll say yes.” Being clear about your intentions is the first step towards getting what you want.

And to finish off - here’s the most important tips of them all: <br>
Just trust your intuition and be real, flirting tips can help you appear all cool on an online dating app but c’mon, you’ve got to impress him/her in real life too!
