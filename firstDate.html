        <p>Congratulations, you’ve worked up the courage to ask that special someone out, and they’ve said yes. Now comes the really hard part: planning your first date. We are here to help you out!</p>

        <h2>Location</h2>
        <div class="pfirstdate">
            <p>The location you choose sets the tone for your date. Unless you already know what types of activities your date likes, it’s best to pick a neutral, low-pressure place where you can focus on getting to know each other.</p>

        <h2>Keys to a great conversation</h2>
        <div class="pfirstdate">
            <p>If you’re quiet or have social anxiety, the most nerve-wracking part of going on a first date is trying to have an engaging conversation with someone you barely know. Luckily, psychologists have discovered some keys to the perfect dating conversations.</p>
            <p>The key to a successful conversation in any context–especially when you’re trying to “wow” someone–is reciprocity. When someone shares something about themselves or asks you a question, always reply back by sharing a similar story, or by asking them the same question. It’s polite and it keeps the conversation equal.</p>

        <h2>Body language</h2>
        <div class="pfirstdate">
            <p>Taking a deeper look at how you present yourself bleeds into your date in the way you communicate both verbally and nonverbally. In fact, your nonverbals (your body language and facial expressions) are perhaps the loudest thing you communicate.

                I know it can sometimes feel out of your control — how can you be aware of your body language and still act natural? All it takes is catching known negative body language and tweaking it a little. Click here for tips on what to do (link).</p>

        <h2>Be interested to be interesting</h2>
        <div class="pfirstdate">
            <p>Everyone — and I mean everyone — enjoys talking about themselves. By asking your date questions about them (and continuing the dialogue with your own thoughts when there’s an opening), you’re showing that you’re interested in them. That, in turn, makes you more interesting. Being aloof may look good on a magazine, but is no fun for anyone in real life.

                It’s not just important to be interested in your date, you should also show interest in the topics that come up. Curiosity is exciting! </p>
